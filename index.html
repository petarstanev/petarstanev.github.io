          <p>
            When I got promoted to a Software developer position I was invited
            to join Members UI(user interface) team. The team was responsible
            for all member's pages including Register, Login, Payments, and
            Verification. The pages were displayed across different products
            Sports, Casino, Gaming and others. The team was working on
            converting a monolith ASP.NET project to GO Microservices for the
            backend and an in-house framework using Typescript for the frontend.
            The first part of the project was loading current pages in an inline
            frame. This allowed us to work on the project on a page-by-page
            basis. One of the interesting parts of this project was that
            different countries had different content on the member's pages. We
            added a feature to our in-house framework to have localization
            logic. This allowed us to deploy only the UI code that is used for a
            selected country.

          <p>
            My first position in Bet365 was as a Front end developer in the
            Sports UI(user interface) team. The focus of my work was developing
            a mobile-first responsible sports website. The work was done on a
            component-by-component basis. It involved gathering requirements,
            analysis of existing components, creating new components, testing,
            deploying and maintaining. The project used an In-house framework
            that had concepts from Angular and React. The programming language
            was Typescript and Sass was used as CSS preprocessor. The project
            goal was to create a betting website that followed W3C standards
            with a focus on accessibility.

            After finishing my placement year I was working at the White Label
            team in TopCashback. The team was responsible for several
            white-label sites based in the UK and internationally. The websites
            used ASP.Net MVC using C# and they had different codebase from each
            other and our main website. An interesting challenge was that for
            the white-label websites we used RavenDB as a NoSQL database while
            for the main website we used an SQL database. I was involved in
            creating a project that involved the synchronization of data between
            the two databases. Because of the spikes in the traffic we also
            added RabbitMQ to queue updates between the databases.

            In my placement year, I worked at the Business Critical team which
            was responsible for developing features, testing, refactoring and
            deploying for TopCashback UK, US and India sites. The websites had
            one code base and were using ASP.NET Web Forms with VB.NET, SCSS and
            jQuery for the frontend. I also worked on a Back Office tool that
            was used for managing the content on the website. I worked on this
            tool to allow text and/or images to be displayed on the website as
            Offers, Promotions and Banners and others.

          <h4>Student Internship</h4>
          <span>June - September 2013</span>
          <p>
            My student internship at DevriX started with an introduction to
            Content Management Systems(CMS) and WordPress. The introduction
            included setting up a WordPress site in a local environment and an
            explanation of the benefits of using CMS. The second part of the
            internship was going through a tutorial on building a simple plugin
            and theme for WordPress. After successfully completing the tutorial
            projects the students in the internship developed a URL Shortener
            WordPress plugin similar Bitly and Google URL Shortener. We have
            successfully developed the plugin that converted long URL to short
            ones and as an addition, there was a tracking management tool that
            allowed us to see the number of clicks on certain URLs. The
            internship allowed me to experience working in a real company and
            improving my technical skills: PHP, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS and
            developing my soft skills: Communication, Teamwork, Problem-solving
            and Time management.
